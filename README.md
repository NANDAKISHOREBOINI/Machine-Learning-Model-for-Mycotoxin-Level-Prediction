# Machine Learning Model for Mycotoxin Prediction

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project and run the code:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher). Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install the necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook
To execute the project, open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to the `.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

```
├── data/                   # Folder containing datasets
├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
│   ├── MachineLearningIMAGOAI.ipynb  # Main notebook with model implementation
├── models/                 # Trained models and saved weights (if applicable)
├── README.md               # Project documentation (this file)
├── requirements.txt        # List of dependencies
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.
- Modify hyperparameters in the notebook if needed for further optimization.
- Results and figures will be generated within the notebook during execution.

For further assistance, refer to the comments within the ipynb notebook.
